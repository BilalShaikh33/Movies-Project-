        <dd>Mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher Walter White thinks his life can't get much worse. His salary
            barely makes ends meet, a situation not likely to improve once his pregnant wife gives birth, and their
            teenage son is battling cerebral palsy. But Walter is dumbstruck when he learns he has terminal cancer.
            Realizing that his illness probably will ruin his family financially, Walter makes a desperate bid to earn
            as much money as he can in the time he has left by turning an old RV into a meth lab on wheels.
